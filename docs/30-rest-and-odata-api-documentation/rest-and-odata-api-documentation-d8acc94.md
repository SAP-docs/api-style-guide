## About REST APIs

REST \(Representational State Transfer\) APIs \(also called RESTful Web Services\) are cross-platform APIs used to perform CRUD \(Create, Read, Update, Delete\) operations on data resources using the HTTP protocol. It uses HTTP methods to interact with resources that are identified using a Uniform Resource Identifier \(URI\). Requests and responses are sent in a structured format.

Unlike SOAP \(Simple Object Access Protocol\) APIs, which are action-oriented, REST APIs are resource-oriented. A SOAP API, for example, requests to get material data, whereas a REST API identifies material data as a resource using a URI and HTTP methods to determine which operation is performed on the resource.

The following table maps CRUD operations to HTTP methods:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

CRUD Operation



</th>
<th valign="top">

HTTP Method



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Create



</td>
<td valign="top">

PUT/POST



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Read



</td>
<td valign="top">

GET



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Update



</td>
<td valign="top">

PUT/PATCH



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

Delete



</td>
<td valign="top">

DELETE



</td>
</tr>
</table>

An individual REST API is defined by the following:

-   Resource URI
-   Operation \(HTTP method\)
-   Request format
-   Request parameters
-   Response format

A REST API is usually a collection of related methods that perform different data operations on the same resource or related set of resources.

## About OData

The Open Data Protocol \(OData\), defined by OASIS is a REST-based protocol for querying and updating data. It’s built on standardized technologies such as HTTP, Atom/XML, and JSON. The difference between OData and pure REST APIs is that it provides a structured way to describe the data and the data model.

In a nutshell, OData is an open protocol that exchanges data over the internet. A server hosts data, and clients can call the server to retrieve data and then manipulate the data to be used however it needs to be consumed. The data that is retrieved by the client is described by the abstract data model called an Entity Data Model \(EDM\). The central concepts in the EDM are entities, entity sets, relationships, and operations.

-   Entities are data objects of a certain type, such as Customer or Employee.
-   Entity sets are named collections of entities, such as Customers.
-   Relationships connect one entity to another.
-   Operations, such as Create or Update, are executed on entities.

Client applications can query an OData service to discover its data model and capabilities, and perform CRUD operations on entities using REST APIs. Let's use SAP SuccessFactors' `Employment Information` API as an example to see what you can query:

### OData Service Types and Documentation Requirements

OData services can be divided into two main types:

-   **OData producer services** 

    Services that expose their data using REST APIs according to the OData protocol.

-   **OData consumer services**

    Applications that consume OData producer services and publish client APIs in different languages to facilitate data access. For example, client libraries for various development platforms and devices, or open data portals.


Audience and documentation requirements differ for APIs published by OData producers and consumers:


<table>
<tr>
<th valign="top">

Publisher



</th>
<th valign="top">

Audience



</th>
<th valign="top">

Documentation Requirements



</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

OData producer



</td>
<td valign="top">

Developers who directly consume the producer's data services in their applications or create their own consumer services.



</td>
<td valign="top">

Producer OData APIs are REST-based. Documentation should include information about:

-   Entity Data Model \(EDM\)
-   Service endpoints and permissions
-   Supported authentication protocols
-   Supported OData features
-   Versions of the protocol
-   Relevant implementation specifics and limitations
-   Resources
-   Operations



</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top">

OData consumer



</td>
<td valign="top">

Developers who access the data from their client apps using the consumer's APIs.



</td>
<td valign="top">

API documentation is written according to the standard for the platform, technology, or language in which the APIs are created, such as Java or .NET.
