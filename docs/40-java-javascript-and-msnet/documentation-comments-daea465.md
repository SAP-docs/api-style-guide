# Documentation Comments

To generate the API reference, write documentation comments in the API source code according to specific rules.

You write a documentation comment before the declaration of a namespace, class, interface, or class/interface member. A comment is usually made up of a description and block tags, separated by delimiters.

The following figures show the structure and syntax of a documentation comment.

For .NET APIs, you can place documentation comments in an external XML file, and then use the `<include>` tag to reference that file in the source code.
