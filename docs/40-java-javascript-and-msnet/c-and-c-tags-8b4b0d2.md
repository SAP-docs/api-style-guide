# C and C++ Tags

A reference of the C and C++ block and inline tags that you can use in documentation comments.



The tags used in C and C++ are similar to those used in Java, but are prefaced with a backslash \(\\\) instead of an @ symbol, for example: `\param`, `\return`, and `\see`. Otherwise, the recommended standards and guidelines for Java apply to C and C++ as well.

> ### Note:  
> This section covers some tags specific to the Doxygen generator that you can use for documentation comments.
