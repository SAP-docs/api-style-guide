# Developer or Service Guides

Developer or service guides complement API references by describing how to use an API and related services, any SDKs, or the development platform in general.

Developer or service guides cover different platforms, technologies, and products, and differ in size and scope. It's therefore not possible to have a single standard that applies in all cases.

In this section, we provide generic guidelines about how to make your developer or service guides clear, concise, helpful, and easy to use.

Developer or service guides contain the following:

-   Conceptual details, such as the goal, scope, and capabilities of an API, architectural diagrams that explain the API structure, and how the API is consumed from a user's perspective.
-   Explanation on how to add code qualities like secure programming, resilience, or performance.

-   Access information, such as security requirements, the initial setup, and configuration information.
-   Usage information, such as typical tasks and scenarios in which the API is used, along with sample code and tutorials.

UA developers create and maintain developer or service guides together with the regular product documentation.
