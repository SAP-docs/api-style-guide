# Guidelines for Development Teams

To ensure that your APIs reach the highest possible quality, we recommend that you follow a few best practices.

-   Prepare API specifications.
-   Plan API reviews in the same development cycle as the API implementation.
-   Include API reviews in relevant backlog items so that the review process is transparent and can be tracked.
-   Submit APIs for review as early as possible; late submissions put the review at risk.
-   Implement the review feedback in full, otherwise you lose part of its benefits.
-   Implement the review before APIs are used by any consumers \(internal and external\).
-   Perform a quality check \(see [API Quality Checklist](api-quality-checklist-35f6961.md)\).
