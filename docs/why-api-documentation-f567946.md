# Why API Documentation?

API documentation is a pillar of the developer experience. Good API documentation ensures that the developers fully understand the API, can use it, and don't get stuck.

Along with communication and support, API documentation is essential to customer adoption and retention. It answers the following questions:

-   What does the API do?
-   How can I get started?
-   How do I consume the API?

## Documentation Deliverables



### API Reference

API documentation starts with an API reference that lists the classes or endpoints and basically describes what they do. The API reference is the cornerstone of your documentation and the minimum that you must provide. Be as thorough as possible, and include lots of code examples.

API references are created and maintained by developers in software source code. The descriptions are written, or the raw text is edited by, User Assistance \(UA\) developers. API references are written according to the standards of the specific API language. There are tools to generate API documentation automatically from source code and if auto-generation isn’t applicable, the documentation is written manually by UA developers in cooperation with developers.



### Additional API Documentation

API references don’t address all developer needs. In addition to API references, there are other types of API documentation:

-   Developer Guides

    A developer guide can contain conceptual, technical, and functional information about how to install, deploy, access, and use the API. Typically, workflows or tutorials can be included, as well as scope and concepts, diagrams, setup information, technical requirements, security information, or code examples.

-   Workflows

    A series of simple tasks that explain how to do something specific with the API. For example, a series of endpoints that are always used in a certain order.

-   Tutorials

    Step-by-step guides that target common business use cases or regular tasks, such as getting started with or configuring the API.

-   Error Messages

    Error messages that show up when using an API must not only describe a problem, but also provide a solution. Make them user-friendly and easy to understand.
